## Overview

The goal of this project is to explore how recommendation systems can use historical user ratings and item-to-item similarities to suggest relevant movies.

The project includes a popularity-based baseline and an item-based collaborative filtering implementation, with offline ranking evaluation comparing their recommendation quality.

The deployed application provides three recommendation experiences:

1. Popular movie recommendations.
2. Similar-movie recommendations based on a selected movie.
3. Precomputed personalized demo recommendations for selected users.

The application uses a React frontend connected to a FastAPI backend.

## Live Deployment

The application is deployed using Vercel and Render.

| Component | Platform | URL |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | Vercel | https://large-scale-recommendation-engine.vercel.app/ |
| Backend API | Render | https://recommendation-engine-api.onrender.com/ |
| Interactive API Documentation | FastAPI Swagger UI | https://recommendation-engine-api.onrender.com/docs |
| API Health Check | Render | https://recommendation-engine-api.onrender.com/health |

**Deployment architecture:**

- React frontend hosted on Vercel.
- FastAPI backend hosted on Render.
- Vercel rewrites `/api/*` requests to the Render backend.
- Recommendation artifacts are loaded by the backend.

Note: Render's free web service may sleep after inactivity. The first request after a period of inactivity can take longer.

## Current Features

- MovieLens 25M dataset auditing and validation.
- Chronological training, validation, and test split.
- Popularity-based recommendation baseline with Bayesian smoothing.
- Item-based collaborative filtering using positive user ratings in the offline pipeline.
- Top-K similar-movie artifact generation.
- Offline Recall@10 and NDCG@10 evaluation.
- FastAPI endpoints for popular, similar-movie, and personalized demo recommendations.
- React and Vite frontend for interactive movie recommendations.
- Precomputed personalized demo recommendations for user IDs 1, 2, and 3.
- Automated API tests using pytest.
- Live frontend and backend deployment.

```

The offline item-based collaborative filtering pipeline uses historical user ratings to calculate item similarities and generate recommendation artifacts.

The deployed API serves recommendations from these precomputed artifacts. The personalized demo endpoint currently serves precomputed recommendations for selected user IDs rather than dynamically generating recommendations from a live user-rating database.

## Dataset

This project uses the MovieLens 25M ratings dataset.

Dataset audit results:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Total ratings | 25,000,095 |
| Unique users | 162,541 |
| Unique rated movies | 59,047 |
| Total movies in metadata | 62,423 |
| Missing rating values | 0 |
| Duplicate movie IDs in movie metadata | 0 |

The processed training dataset contains 20,062,533 interactions. The split is chronological per user to reduce temporal leakage during evaluation.

| Split | Interactions |
|---|---:|
| Training | 20,062,533 |
| Validation | 2,506,501 |
| Test | 2,431,061 |

A rating of 4.0 or higher is treated as a relevant interaction for the reported ranking evaluation.

Download MovieLens 25M from the official source:

https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/

Extract the dataset so that the raw files are available under `data/raw/ml-25m/`.

Do not commit the full dataset to Git.

## Evaluation Results

The following results come from the offline item-similarity evaluation report. Both methods use the same evaluated user cohort and exclude items seen in training.

| Metric | Popularity Baseline | Item-Based Collaborative Filtering |
|---|---:|---:|
| Evaluated users | 150,626 | 150,626 |
| Recall@10 | 0.024811 | 0.081949 |
| NDCG@10 | 0.020305 | 0.070637 |

### Interpretation

- Recall@10 improves by 0.057138 in absolute terms.
- NDCG@10 improves by 0.050332 in absolute terms.
- Item-based collaborative filtering achieves approximately 3.30 times the baseline Recall@10 on this evaluation cohort.

These are offline ranking metrics, not online A/B test results. They do not establish production performance or business impact.

A separate popularity evaluation report uses a different protocol and cohort. Its results should not be directly compared with the table above.

Generated data and model artifacts may be excluded from Git depending on their size. The deployed backend requires the three recommendation artifacts listed above to be available.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- Node.js and npm
- Git
- MovieLens 25M dataset

Run commands from the repository root in PowerShell.

### 1. Clone the repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Mayank-Ninawe/large-scale-recommendation-engine.git

cd large-scale-recommendation-engine
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```powershell
py -3.10 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If PowerShell blocks activation, invoke the environment's Python executable directly instead.

### 3. Install dependencies

For application dependencies:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For development and testing:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### 4. Install frontend dependencies

```powershell
npm --prefix .\frontend install
```

## Prepare the Dataset

Run the dataset audit:

```powershell
python .\scripts\audit_dataset.py
```

Prepare chronological train, validation, and test files:

```powershell
python .\scripts\prepare_dataset.py
```

Validate the generated split:

```powershell
python .\scripts\validate_split.py
```

The processed training file is expected at:

`data/processed/train.csv.gz`

Use the generated audit and validation reports to verify dataset integrity.

## Build Recommendation Artifacts

Run these commands from the repository root after preparing the dataset.

### 1. Build the popularity baseline

```powershell
python .\ml\retrieval\popularity_baseline.py
```

### 2. Build item-similarity recommendations

```powershell
python .\ml\retrieval\item_similarity.py
```

The backend expects these artifacts:

- `ml/artifacts/popularity_ranking.csv`
- `ml/artifacts/item_similarity_topk.csv`
- `ml/artifacts/demo_recommendations.json`

The demo JSON contains precomputed recommendation responses for user IDs 1, 2, and 3.

### 3. Evaluate the models

```powershell
python .\ml\evaluation\evaluate_popularity.py
python .\ml\evaluation\evaluate_popularity_v2.py
python .\ml\evaluation\evaluate_item_similarity.py
```

Evaluation reports are written under `data/reports/` by the respective scripts.

## Run the Backend

Ensure the three required recommendation artifacts exist.

Start FastAPI from the repository root:

```powershell
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

The local API is available at:

- Base URL: http://127.0.0.1:8001/
- Interactive API documentation: http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs
- Health check: http://127.0.0.1:8001/health

Keep this terminal running while using the frontend.

## Run the Frontend

Open a second PowerShell terminal at the repository root:

```powershell
npm --prefix .\frontend run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite, usually:

http://localhost:5173

The Vite development server proxies `/api` requests to the local FastAPI server on port 8001.

To create a production build:

```powershell
npm --prefix .\frontend run build
```

## Run Tests

Install development dependencies, then run:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests\test_api.py -v
```

The API test suite currently contains 12 tests covering home and health endpoints, recommendation responses, input limits, known and unknown IDs, and personalized demo behavior.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/` | API home and status |
| GET | `/health` | Health check and artifact loading status |
| GET | `/recommendations/popular?limit=10` | Popular movie recommendations |
| GET | `/recommendations/movie/{movie_id}?limit=10` | Similar movies |
| GET | `/recommendations/user/{user_id}?limit=10` | Precomputed personalized demo recommendations |

The optional `limit` parameter defaults to `10` and accepts values from `1` to `50`.

### Example requests

```text
GET https://recommendation-engine-api.onrender.com/health

GET https://recommendation-engine-api.onrender.com/recommendations/popular?limit=10

GET https://recommendation-engine-api.onrender.com/recommendations/movie/318?limit=10

GET https://recommendation-engine-api.onrender.com/recommendations/user/1?limit=10
```

### Recommendation behavior

- **Popular movies:** Ranked using the precomputed popularity baseline. Results include `rating_count`, `average_rating`, and `weighted_score`.
- **Similar movies:** Returns related movies ordered by item similarity. Results include `similarity`.
- **Personalized demo recommendations:** Returns precomputed recommendations for user IDs `1`, `2`, and `3`. Results include `personalized_score` and `liked_movies_used`.
- **Unknown IDs:** Unknown movies and unsupported demo user IDs return HTTP `404`.
- **Invalid limits:** Values outside `1` to `50` are rejected by API validation.

### Example response fields

A popular recommendation includes fields such as:

```json
{
  "movieId": 318,
  "title": "The Shawshank Redemption (1994)",
  "genres": "Crime|Drama",
  "rating_count": 75362,
  "average_rating": 4.418,
  "weighted_score": 4.418
}
```

A personalized demo recommendation includes fields such as:

```json
{
  "movieId": 4226,
  "title": "Memento (2000)",
  "genres": "Mystery|Thriller",
  "personalized_score": 4.1816
}
```

Similar-movie responses include a `similarity` score. Exact scores depend on the generated recommendation artifacts.

## Current Limitations and Future Work

The current implementation is a working recommendation-system baseline with a deployed web application. It is not yet the complete neural two-stage architecture originally envisioned.

Current limitations:

1. Personalized recommendations are currently precomputed for demo user IDs `1`, `2`, and `3`.
2. The deployed personalized endpoint does not dynamically calculate recommendations for arbitrary users.
3. The API serves precomputed recommendation artifacts rather than running a continuously updated training or inference pipeline.
4. The deployed implementation does not yet include the planned Two-Tower retrieval model, FAISS vector index, or deep-learning ranking model.

Potential next steps:

1. Implement dynamic user-based recommendation generation.
2. Add a Two-Tower retrieval model and evaluate it against item-based retrieval.
3. Integrate FAISS for approximate nearest-neighbor retrieval and benchmark it.
4. Add a learned ranking model such as DCN and compare it using the same evaluation protocol.
5. Add Redis caching and measure its effect on latency.
6. Add reproducible Docker deployment and workflow orchestration.
7. Expand monitoring, API observability, and performance testing.

Advanced components should be described as completed only after their implementation and results have been verified.
